# Branch protection on `main`, built from the tree:
#
#   scripts/protect-main.sh [--dry-run]   print the PUT body and diff it against the live rule (default)
#   scripts/protect-main.sh --apply       PUT it, read it back, exit 1 unless the read-back matches
#
# No rule yet (GET answers exactly "Branch not protected", HTTP 404): the dry-run says
# it would CREATE, --apply PUTs and reads back as for an update. Any other refusal
# (another 404, the plan's "Upgrade to GitHub Pro" answer, a 403) or an unparseable
# answer is REFUSED: only that 404 says the plan supports protection.
#
# The required checks come from .github/required-checks.json, the one list
# (test/ci-workflow.test.mjs proves each is a job with no if: in a workflow every pull request runs),
# pinned to GitHub Actions (app 15368) so no other app can post a pass. Every
# other setting is restated, because a PUT REPLACES the whole rule: strict
# (up to date before merge), admins included, a pull request required with 0
# approvals and stale approvals dismissed, linear history, conversations resolved,
# no force-push, no deletion. Trade-off for the owner: with admins included, a
# billing stop blocks every merge until the rule is lifted.
#
# Not covered by this PUT: `required_signatures` (its own endpoint) and
# `block_creations`; both read false today and the diff ignores them.
